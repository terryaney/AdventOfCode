No idea on how to solve part 2 :(  Almost all solutions/discussions on the web were Python using [sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) library which I don't have access to.  I tried to use [nerdamer](https://nerdamer.com/) and [mathjs](https://mathjs.org/) after watching HyperNeutrino's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guOyA7Ijqgk) but couldn't figure out how to translate nerdamer or mathjs to do same concepts he was using in sympy.

I then tried to translate a Python [solution](https://github.com/joshackland/advent_of_code/blob/master/2023/python/24.py) from Josh Ackland (who [admittedly](https://youtu.be/91qd9Uv2I9E?t=1089) copied a solution from somewhere for part 2) but that failed to return a result for the real data (sample data passed).  His solution is in this [commit](https://github.com/terryaney/advent-of-code/commit/a4073ebad9be4e5bdabefd1b215e344b9e4d6226).

I then tried to translate a Kotlin [solution](https://github.com/werner77/AdventOfCode/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/behindmedia/adventofcode/year2023/day24/Day24.kt) from Werner Altewischer after watching his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP2ahZs40U8&t=231s) but his failed to return a result even for the test data.  I've submitted an [issue](https://github.com/werner77/AdventOfCode/issues/2) asking if he wants to peek at code, so we'll see.

## Results
