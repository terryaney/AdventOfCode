## Notes

Part 2 was too long, so needed to use [shoelace formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula) 

[Hyper's explanation of shoelace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGWK76_e-LM) and 'pick' because shoelace 'by default' misses 'outer half' of each grid sqaure b/c points are in the 'center' of the grid

[Followed this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxNVXQNMA7o) to learn. This has 'trial and error' fix of `+ this.permimeter / 2 + 1` to solve for the 'pick' problem.  (implemented based on this video)

[Paulson talks about shoelace and 'green' formulas](https://github.com/jonathanpaulson/AdventOfCode), can't quite track his shoelace code though.
