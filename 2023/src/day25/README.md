## Notes

I have no Graph Theory experience, and just looked around until I found a pure solution (not using libraries that do not exist in TypeScript) that I could translate into TypeScript.  Thanks to [Paul Wild's Solution](https://github.com/PaulWild/advent-of-code-2023/blob/main/AdventOfCode/Days/Day25.cs) I was able to get this done.

> I implemented [karger's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karger%27s_algorithm) which is a randomized algorithm to find the minimum number of cuts to split a graph in two. Obviously we already have that information (3) but a small tweak to the algorithm to track which nodes have been contracted together gives you the two numbers needed to get the solution

I might go back and look at [encse writeup](https://aoc.csokavar.hu/?day=25) as I like his style, but I found it after I finished and will have to wait :)
