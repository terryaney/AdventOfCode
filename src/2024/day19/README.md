## Notes

Hypernuetrino reminded me of making my recursive function cacheable and also using a `Set` instead of array and looping through each element in array to see if current design 'started' with that.  Problem with my originally solution is that there were few hundred patterns I was looping through each time, versus using a `Set` where I could just loop through N iterations where N was the max length of largest pattern.
